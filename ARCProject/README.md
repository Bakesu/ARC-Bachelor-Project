# ARC Bachelor Project

## Overview
This project explores different mode-switching techniques for freehand sketching in Augmented Reality (AR). The goal is to create a seamless experience for switching between drawing, conversation, and object manipulation in a co-located collaborative setting. The project was developed for the Microsoft HoloLens 2 and evaluates three different activation techniques:

Pinch&Menu: A baseline toggle-based technique inspired by Microsoft Mesh.

Gaze: Uses gaze tracking to enable drawing.

Two-Hand: Activates drawing through two-handed gestures.

## Technologies Used
